#
# Restore the License Service database from a dump produced by
# backup_db.sh. Makes the DISASTER_RECOVERY runbook executable instead
# of improvised-at-3am.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   1. Verifies the dump is readable (pg_restore --list) BEFORE touching
#      anything — a corrupt dump must not cost you the current database.
#   2. Takes a fresh dump of the CURRENT database to
#      <BACKUP_DIR>/pre-restore-<stamp>.dump. This is the rollback point.
#      Command Center's SQLite-era script could just move the old file
#      aside; a live Postgres has no such move, so the rollback has to be
#      created explicitly. Skipped only with --no-rollback-dump.
#   3. Restores with --clean --if-exists, which drops and recreates each
#      object. This is DESTRUCTIVE and requires typing the confirmation
#      phrase (or passing --yes for unattended use).
#
# IMPORTANT: stop the app first so nothing is writing during the restore.
#   On Fly:  fly machine stop <id>, restore, then start.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/restore_db.sh /data/backups/licenses-<stamp>.dump
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... bash scripts/restore_db.sh ./backup.dump --yes
#
# ENV
#   DATABASE_URL   required — the database to restore INTO.
#   BACKUP_DIR     default /data/backups (where the rollback dump lands)

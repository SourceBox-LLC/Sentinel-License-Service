# Consistent Postgres backup for the License Service database.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The managed cluster takes its own snapshots, and those are the
#   PRIMARY backup. This script exists for the thing snapshots can't do:
#   produce a portable dump that can be restored somewhere else — a
#   different provider, a local machine, a fresh cluster — so a Fly
#   account/region loss can't take the backups down with the primary.
#   It is also the only copy you can inspect before restoring.
#
#   (Before 2026-09, this service stored licences in SQLite and had no
#   scheduled backup at all. The database moved to Postgres and this job
#   was added with it, mirroring Command Center's so the runbook around
#   it applies to both.)
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   1. Dumps with pg_dump in custom format (-Fc): compressed, and
#      restorable selectively with pg_restore (single table, schema
#      only, reordered) rather than all-or-nothing.
#   2. Verifies the dump by reading its table of contents back with
#      `pg_restore --list` — the moral equivalent of the old
#      PRAGMA integrity_check, and it catches a truncated file.
#   3. If BACKUP_S3_BUCKET is set and the `aws` CLI is present, uploads
#      it to object storage (off-platform durability).
#   4. Prunes local backups older than BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS.
#
# USAGE
#   On the Fly machine:   bash scripts/backup_db.sh
#   Locally:              DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... bash scripts/backup_db.sh
#
# ENV
#   DATABASE_URL           required. Read from the app's own environment
#                          on the machine, so there is no second copy of
#                          the credential to drift.
#   BACKUP_DIR             default /data/backups
#   BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS  default 14  (local copies)
#   BACKUP_S3_BUCKET       optional, e.g. s3://my-bucket/license-backups
#                          (requires the aws CLI + credentials in env)
#
# Run it from a scheduled GitHub Action (see .github/workflows/backup.yml
# and Command Center's docs/runbooks/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md).
